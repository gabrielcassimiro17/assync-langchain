32287,US,"Scents of chamomile tea with generous honey and lemon get down with white flowers and baking pie crust on this offering from Pierre Lafond, who's been making wine since the 1960s. The wine dances across the tongue, with bright papaya, pear and a dill-powered, nearly bitter finish. It's showing almost no age, so it will hold well, but it's also brilliant right now.",Lafond Vineyard,93,40.0,California,Sta.

17550,US,"Grape fruit leather, dense violets, black slate and a hint of barnyard aromas make for an interesting, purple-leaning nose on this wine. The palate is quite herbal, tinged with dried oregano as well as a berry-juice ripeness.",,86,34.0,California,Carmel Valley,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Joullian 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Carmel Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Joullian,17550
